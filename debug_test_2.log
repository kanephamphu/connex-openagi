### Inner Monologue

1. **Core Objective**:  
   The user wants a concise and up-to-date summary of the latest advancements in reasoning models, specifically focusing on models like DeepSeek-R1 or OpenAI o1 from the years 2025-2026. The summary should be saved as a markdown report.

2. **Capability Check**:  
   - **Skills/Tools Needed**:
     - `web_search`: To find the latest information on reasoning models from 2025-2026.
     - `browser`: To access and verify the information found.
     - `file_manager`: To save the report as 'research_report.md'.
     - `llm_text_analyzer` or `text_analyzer`: To help in summarizing the information effectively.

3. **Constraint Analysis**:  
   - **Missing Inputs**: I don't have direct access to future data (2025-2026), so I need to simulate this by assuming the context of the request.
   - **Risks**: The information might not be available due to the future timeframe. I need to ensure that I provide a logical and structured report based on current trends and potential advancements.
   - **Ambiguities**: The specific details about DeepSeek-R1 or OpenAI o1 are not provided, so I need to focus on general advancements in reasoning models.

4. **Strategic Plan**:
   - **Step 1**: Use `web_search` to find the latest information on reasoning models, focusing on DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1, assuming the context of 2025-2026.
   - **Step 2**: Use `llm_text_analyzer` or `text_analyzer` to summarize the findings into a concise markdown format.
   - **Step 3**: Use `file_manager` to save the summary as 'research_report.md'.
   - **Self-Correction Strategy**: If Step 1 fails due to lack of data, I will focus on current trends and advancements in reasoning models and extrapolate potential future developments based on these trends.
