### Inner Monologue

1. **Core Objective**: 
   The user wants a summary of the latest advancements in reasoning models, specifically those like DeepSeek-R1 or OpenAI o1, from the years 2025-2026. This summary should be compiled into a markdown report and saved as 'research_report.md'. The user is looking for a concise and informative report on the state-of-the-art in reasoning models during that period.

2. **Capability Check**: 
   - **Web Search**: To find the latest information on reasoning models from 2025-2026.
   - **Browser**: To access and navigate web pages for detailed information.
   - **File Manager**: To save the markdown report as 'research_report.md'.
   - **LLM Text Analyzer**: To help summarize the information gathered into a coherent markdown report.

3. **Constraint Analysis**: 
   - **Missing Inputs**: I do not have direct access to future data (2025-2026) as my training only goes up to October 2023.
   - **Risks**: The information might not be available due to the time constraint.
   - **Ambiguities**: The specific details of what constitutes "advancements" in reasoning models are not defined, so I will focus on general improvements, new models, and significant breakthroughs.

4. **Strategic Plan**:
   - **Step 1**: Use the 'web_search' skill to look for any available information on reasoning models from 2025-2026.
   - **Step 2**: Use the 'browser' skill to access detailed articles or papers that might have been published about these models.
   - **Step 3**: Use the 'LLM Text Analyzer' to summarize the findings into a concise markdown report.
   - **Step 4**: Use the 'file_manager' to save the report as 'research_report.md'.

   - **Self-Correction Strategy**: 
     - If Step 1 fails to find any information, I will broaden the search to include predictions or ongoing research trends in reasoning models as of 2023, which might hint at future advancements.
     - If the information is still insufficient, I will provide a report based on the most recent data available and note the limitations.

Given the constraints and tools available, I will proceed with Step 1 using the 'web_search' skill to find any relevant information.[AGI] Reasoning complete. Classifying intent...
