### Inner Monologue

1. **Core Objective**: The user wants a summary of the latest advancements in reasoning models, specifically focusing on models like DeepSeek-R1 or OpenAI o1, from the years 2025-2026. The goal is to compile this information into a markdown report and save it as 'research_report.md'.

2. **Capability Check**: 
   - The 'web_search' and 'browser' skills are essential for gathering the latest information on reasoning models from 2025-2026.
   - The 'file_manager' skill will be needed to save the markdown report.
   - The 'llm_text_analyzer' or 'text_analyzer' can be used to summarize and organize the findings.

3. **Constraint Analysis**: 
   - The main constraint is the lack of direct access to future data (2025-2026) since my training only includes data up to October 2023.
   - There is a risk of not finding accurate or comprehensive information due to the future timeframe.
   - Ambiguity exists in the specific details or aspects of the reasoning models that the user is interested in.

4. **Strategic Plan**:
   - **Step 1**: Use the 'web_search' skill to attempt to find any speculative articles, research papers, or predictions related to reasoning models for 2025-2026.
   - **Step 2**: Use the 'llm_text_analyzer' to process and summarize the gathered information into a coherent markdown report.
   - **Step 3**: Use the 'file_manager' to save the summary as 'research_report.md'.
   - **Self-Correction Strategy**: If Step 1 fails to yield results, I will provide a report based on the latest available data up to 2023 and include a note about the limitations due to the future timeframe.

### Execution

Let's begin by attempting to gather information using the 'web_search' skill. If this fails, I will adjust the strategy accordingly.[AGI] Reasoning complete. Classifying intent...
