### Inner Monologue

1. **Core Objective**:  
   The user wants a concise and up-to-date summary of the latest advancements in reasoning models, specifically from the years 2025-2026. They are interested in models like DeepSeek-R1 or OpenAI o1. The final output should be a markdown report saved as 'research_report.md'.

2. **Capability Check**:  
   To achieve this, I need to gather information from the web, which is beyond my current data training (up to October 2023). The best tools for this task are the 'web_search' and 'browser' skills. Once the information is gathered, I can use 'text_analyzer' to summarize the findings and 'file_manager' to save the report.

3. **Constraint Analysis**:  
   - **Missing Inputs**: I lack direct access to data from 2025-2026.
   - **Risks**: The information might not be available or could be behind paywalls.
   - **API Limits**: Web search might have limitations on the number of queries.
   - **Ambiguities**: Specific models like DeepSeek-R1 or OpenAI o1 might not exist or be well-documented.

4. **Strategic Plan**:
   - **Step 1**: Use 'web_search' to find recent articles, papers, or announcements about reasoning models from 2025-2026.
   - **Step 2**: Use 'browser' to access and review the most relevant sources.
   - **Step 3**: Summarize the key findings using 'text_analyzer'.
   - **Step 4**: Save the summary as 'research_report.md' using 'file_manager'.
   - **Self-Correction Strategy**: If Step 1 fails due to lack of information, I will broaden the search to include related fields or earlier years to gather context and trends.

### Action Plan

1. **Initiate Web Search**: Begin by searching for advancements in reasoning models from 2025-2026.
2. **Access Information**: Use the browser to access detailed information from credible sources.
3. **Summarize Findings**: Analyze and summarize the information.
4. **Save Report**: Compile the summary into a markdown file and save it.
